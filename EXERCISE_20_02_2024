#EXERCISE 20/02/2024: download the penguins dataset from seaborn and execute an EDA
#Save the information derived from EDA in a printable and informative variable. 
#Example is a dictionary of list of strings in which a list contains the information 
#and the key identifies the plot from which information is derived.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os

#get the current directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print("Current working directory:", current_dir)

#set my specific directory
os.chdir("C:/Users/Norma/Desktop/REMOTE_SENSING_DEEP_LEARNING_2024")

#https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv --> this is where I got the dataset from
penguins = pd.read_csv('penguins.csv')
penguins

#create a dataframe from the .csv file
df_penguins = pd.DataFrame(penguins)
print(penguins_df)

#used to have a quick overview of the head of the dataframe
df_penguins.head()

df_penguins.info()

#descriptive statistics of the dataset
df_penguins.describe()

#to see how many missing values
df_penguins.isnull().sum()
